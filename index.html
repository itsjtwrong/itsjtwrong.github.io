  <h1>JT Wright</h1>
<p>I am a student in the worlds of computer science, design, business, and horticulture.<br>
  Right now I am reading <a href="https://www.htdp.org">How to Design Programs</a>, a fantastic intro text on programming and computing.
  <br>
  I am working on Knox in Space, a website that is looking to change the way art and litterature is consumed and compensated, starting on campus.
  <br>
  I am working toward owning a tea shop, you can read about that journey soon.<br>
